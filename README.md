-  INTRODUCTION 
  Diabetes Is  the fastest growing disease among the people even among the youngsters. In understanding diabetes and how it develops, we need to understand what happens 
  in the body without diabetes. Sugar (glucose) comes from the foods that we eat, specifically carbohydrate foods. Carbohydrate foods provide our body with its main 
  energy source everybody, even those people with diabetes, needs carbohydrates. Carbohydrate foods include bread, cereal, pasta, rice, fruit, dairy products and 
  vegetables (especially starchy vegetables). When we eat these foods, the body breaks them down into glucose. The glucose moves around the body in the bloodstream.
  Some of the glucose is taken to our brain to help us think clearly and function. The remainder of the glucose is taken to the cells of our body for energy and also to 
  our liver, where it is stored as energy that is used later by the body. In order for the body to use glucose for energy, insulin is required. Insulin is a hormone 
  that is produced by the beta cells in the pancreas. If the pancreas is not able to produce enough insulin (insulin deficiency) or if the body cannot use the insulin it
  produces (insulin resistance), glucose builds up in the bloodstream (hyperglycaemia) and diabetes develops.To reduce the possibility of developing some 
  serious complications related to diabetes, machine learning and data mining techniques can be applied to diabetes-related datasets.
